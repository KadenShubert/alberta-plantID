# Plant Identification

### Goal
The goal of this project was to provide an application that was capable of identifying a variety of plant species specifically within Alberta due to the diverse ecosystem and to provide a better solution for replanting during things like construction.

### Solution
Images were gathered from publically available sources from a variety of groups within this project. The images for the Canada Buffaloberry were collected using a python script utilizing an API that takes images in the public domain from [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) a source of peer-reviewed plant images. All the plant images were then manually labelled with plant names and bounding boxes by the groups that collected them. A YOLOv8 Object Detection model was trained, and integrated into a hosted Gradio demo.

## Model Training
- Zip files: Zipped folders should be extracted in the repo location as named for the files to run properly.
  - All_Plant_Data: Contains all plant images and labels before restructuring for model training.
  - TrainModels: Contains the proper structure and the images the model was trained on for the Demo.
- Image-Label_Formatting.ipynb: Processes the image & label files in the All_Plant_Data folder by adjusting mislabeled detections, removing images with missing label files, and formatting them into the proper structure for the YOLOv8 model.
- Plant Identification.ipynb: Trains a YOLOv8 model for object detection using the plant image and label files.
- plant-identification.yaml: Contains the data structure for YOLO and the class names used for object detection.

## Image_Collection Process
#### Python scripts
- Filter_observations.py: Filter observations to only contain those from Canada as part of the project requirements.
- additional_images.py: Utilizes the inaturalist API[] to check the Canadian observations for more images and generate a file containing information for all relevant image.
- get_images.py: Downloads the relevant images utilizing the acquired image urls, names the files accordingly, & generates a csv to reference the source of each downloaded image as per project requirements.
- main.py: Runs all the supporting scripts in order, Filter_observations.py > additional_images.py > get_images.py
#### CSV files
- observations_Full.csv: Contains an export of observation information from inaturalist export[] using the information in export_query.txt
- Canadian_Observations.csv: Generated by Filter_observations.py, contains observation_id, observation_url, first image url for only Canadian observations.
- All_Images_CanadianBuffaloBerry.csv: Generated by additonal_images.py, contains observation_id, observation_url, image url for all images related to the Canadian observations.  
- CanadianBuffaloBerry_Canada_Info.csv: Generated by get_images.py, contains the observation url, image url, and saved image name for tracking the source of the images as part of the project requirements.
